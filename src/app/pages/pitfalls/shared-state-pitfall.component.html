  <strong>The bug:</strong> A developer creates two sibling widgets that both provide
  <code>TrackerService</code> at the component level. They expect incrementing the
  counter in Widget A to also update Widget B. But it doesn't &mdash; each widget
  has its own instance!

<p style="margin-bottom: 16px; font-size: 14px;">
  Try incrementing the counter in Widget A. Widget B does <strong>not</strong> update
  because they have different instances:

<div class="card-grid">
  <app-pitfall-widget-a />
  <app-pitfall-widget-b />
</div>

<app-code-snippet
  title="The fix: provide at a shared ancestor level"
  [code]="fixCode"

<div class="explanation-box success">
  <strong>The fix:</strong> Remove <code>providers</code> from both widgets and provide
  the service at a shared ancestor (parent component, route, or root). This way, both
  widgets inherit the same singleton instance.
