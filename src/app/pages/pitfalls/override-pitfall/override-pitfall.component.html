<div class="explanation-box warning">
  <strong>The bug:</strong> A parent relies on a root-level service for shared state.
  A child component re-provides the same service in its own
  <code>providers</code> array. The child silently receives a <strong>fresh, empty
  instance</strong> instead of the root one, and state appears to be "lost."

<div class="explanation-box success">
  <strong>The fix:</strong> Remove the <code>providers</code> array from the child
  component. Without its own provider, the child will inherit the root instance and
  share state with the parent as expected.
